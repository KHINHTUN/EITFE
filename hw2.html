    <h2>Top Programming Languages 2021</h2>
    <p>
      Today we are using technology and it is having an effect.Most people are
      now effectively using computer-understood languages and programming
      languages.<br />
      People control computers and write programs and create software. There are
      two programming languages: advanced programming languages <br />
      and low-level programming languages. Advanced programming language is easy
      to understand and can write words and source code symbols,<br />
      for example<strong> -( Java, C ++, PHP) </strong>Advanced programming
      language is understood as a business model that can run as fast as the
      program provides the cost of the vehicle.<br />
      Of the many programming languages so far,which one is the best in<strong>
        2021 </strong
      >and how will it be used in the future ? Therefore,programmers are needed
      in the future.

      Programming language<strong> 2021 </strong>for game development and much
      more. We are<br />
      compiling a list of<mark> The Top 10 Programming Languages </mark>of the
      future that<br />
      will emerge in<strong> 2021</strong>. Next year could take the programming
      world to a whole<br />
      new place Programming languages are considered to be a hierarchical
      era.<br />No more doors. Mobile app development; Web development၊ Let's
      explore the new <br />programming language<strong> 2021 </strong>for game

    <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>
      Developers use suitable programming languages for their own particular<br />
      project purpose or syntax they want to use to generate instructions.<br />
      Here are different sorts of programming languages they use-

    /></a></li>

    <h2>Low-level Languages</h2>
    <p>
      Using these kinds of languages offers abstraction from the hardware and
      are depicted in the binary<br />
      form that is either<i> 0 or 1 </i>referred to as machine
      instruction.<strong> Low-level </strong>languages also have two
      types<strong
        ><br />
        Machine-level languages.<br />
        Assembly Level Languages.</strong

    <h2>High-level Languages</h2>
    <p>
      It permits developers to code programs that are not related to the type
      of<br />
      computer. These are close to human languages and understandable easily,<br />
      it’s just that it needs attention for the problem<strong> LogiC </strong>.
      It has advantages<br />
      like Easy to maintain and learn Portability with the machine-independency.
