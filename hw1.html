    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Editing <strong> HTML </strong>and<strong> CSS </strong> code can be done
      with nothing but a simple text editor.However,if you’d <br />like to take
      your programming skills <i>(and output)</i> to the next level,it’s worth
      looking into an integrated development environment or
      <strong> IDE </strong>.<br />
      A bare-bones<strong> IDE </strong>will allow you to code,edit, test, and
      debug. However, an advanced<strong> IDE </strong>, like the ones<br />
      listed here, will offer many features that will enhance your programming
      experiences like automation, visualization, and customization.
    </p>
    <h3>We should use the IDE</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
      <li>Sublime Text3</li>
      <li>NetBeans</li>
      <li>PyCharm</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1.Visual Studio Code</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
      <dd>+ High speed</dd>
      <dd>+ Beginner friendly</dd>
      <dd>+ Well documented</dd>
      <dd>+ Interoperability</dd>
      <dd>+ Independency</dd>
      <dd>- Security</dd>
      <dd>- Controllable</dd>
      <dd>- Compatibility</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>2.IntelliJ IDEA</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
      <dd>
        + Inbuilt support for a web server which makes Java web application
        faster.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + Auto code completion. By just typing a few words, it will complete the
        whole code block like try catch.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + Lots of plugins like<strong> Sonar Lint </strong>. Using those you can
        analyse your code while writing it.
      </dd>
      <dd>+ Provides a decompiled code of libraries which can help a lot.</dd>
      <dd>- It is a very heavy tool and consumes a lot of memory.</dd>
      <dd>
        - If you are a new java developer, then you shouldn't use it heavily as
        it will affect your learning ability.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>3.Sublime Text</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
      <dd>
        + The biggest advantage over many other editors is the ability to open
        large files. Some editors just can't open a<strong> CSV </strong>with
        millions of lines but<br /><strong> Sublime Text </strong> does it like
        a champ.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + Multiple selections let you change or create many instances of the
        same variable or value with ease.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + The<i> Goto Anything </i> simplifies navigation and lets you control,
        open, or move within files without ever having to take your hands off
        the keyboard.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + Likewise, the command palette allows you to access any of the
        application's functionality right from the keyboard.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + It is highly customizable with a rich ecosystem of third party plugins
        and the ability to create your own.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - In a world of free and open text editors,<strong>
          Sublime Text </strong
        >does ask for donations. You can use the product freely with only a very
        infrequent popup <br />
        asking for donations. You can use it however long you like without
        paying, but it is well worth it to donate to.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - People not used to the functionality may need a bit of time to get up
        to speed using the documentation.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - An integrated terminal would be nice, but that is just a quibble. It's
        hard to find many cons with<strong> Sublime Text </strong>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>4.NetBeans</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
      <dd>
        + Formatting and defining rules for each language is a very useful
        feature in this<strong> IDE </strong>.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        + The code can be deployed very easy from<strong> Netbeans </strong>
        itself.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        - It should provide more themes and background colors for the code
      </dd>
      window. Some dark themes are good but they slow down the system.<br />
      <dd>
        - There have been a few bugs in the latest version of<strong>
          NetBeans </strong
        >. <br />
        <strong> NetBean's </strong>developer should resolve those bugs.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>5.PyCharm</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
      <dd>+ Data science scripting.</dd>
      <dd>+ Frontend development based on Python.</dd>
      <dd>
        - Community edition is, while quite usable, far behind the paid
        alternative. At least a basic database support would be nice.
      </dd>
    </dl>
