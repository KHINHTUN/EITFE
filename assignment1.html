    <h3>2.What is Programming?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        So, I get this series is about programming, but where and how do I even
        begin?
      </li>
      <li>The process of preparing an instructional program for a device.</li>
      <li>
        Layman’ s Terms- Attempting to get a computer to complete a specific
        task without making mistakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-Intelligent Friend- You Instruct your less than intelligent friend
        to build a logo set.
      </li>
      <li>Replace the friend with a computer and that’ s how we code.</li>
      <li>Computer ‘s are only smart because we program them to be.</li>
      <li>Computers only understand machine code.</li>
      <li>
        You need to convert your instructions from English to Mandarin in order
        for him to understand them.
      </li>
      <li>Programming languages serve as a middle-man of sorts.</li>
      <li>Translate your instructions into machine code.</li>
      <li>Very useful for programmers.</li>
      <li>
        Programming Languages serve as interpreters for converting languages
        into other languages.
      </li>
      <li>languages serve this same function.</li>
      <li>They’re able to convert your code into machine code.</li>
      <li>Java and Python-General purpose languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>3.How do we write Code?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A place to write, run, and debug code and also convert it to machine
        code.
      </li>
      <li>Examples (NetBeans, visual studios).</li>
      <li>
        All programming languages have a set of rules you must follow when
        writing code in that languages, just like in real languages. Similar to
        grammar in real life languages.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>4.How do we get information from Computer?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Programmers keep track f their progress by looking at the console. Print
        statement is also used for viewing and interpreting the computer’ s
        output from a program.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>5.What can computer’s do?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most programming languages has an additional operator known as modulus.
        Allows us to get the remainder of a divisional operation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>6.What are Variables?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many types of variables, but we will be focusing on primitive type
        variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>7.How do we Manipulate Variables?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        How do we change the variables we have, and how do we even make then.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>8.What are Conditional Statements?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Depending on certain conditions, we want our code to do different
        things.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>9.What are Arrays?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An array is list of something, 1. Can be Integers 2. Can be Strings 3.
        Can even be other array’ s.
      </li>
      <li>
        All information in an array is related. Like columns in Google Sheets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>10.What are Loops?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A loop is a statement that is used to run certain instructions
        repeatedly. Very useful for repeated sections of code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>11. What are Errors?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Code doesn’t always work as expected. These are known as errors (come up
        often in computer science). Three different types (Syntax Errors,
        Runtime Errors, Logic Errors).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>12. How do we Debug code?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First step is to read the error (IDE will often print out an error
        message to the console). Traverse to this line of code provided by the
        error. Use online forums such as Stack Overflow.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>13. What are functions?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We ‘ve actually been using functions this whole video(Print Statements,
        For Loops , Basic Math Operators)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>14. How can import functions?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Importing Functions allows you to gain access to libraries of pre-made
        functions(There are thousands of already made functions at your
        disposal).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>15. How do we make our own functions?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What do we do when we can’t find a function online to suit our needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most important thing about making functions that return variables is
        that no matter what path your code takes, it must return a variable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>16. What are Array Lists and Dictionaries?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Arrays (Lists of similar values that are stored together, Fixed Size
        (Cannot be increased), Reference values using an index which starts
        at0).
      </li>
      <li>
        Useful for when you don’t know the exact number of values that the array
        list will need to store. Also for if you want the ability to store
        values to your heart’s content(Such as a Database of users).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>17.How can we use Data Structures?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Searching Algorithms (Ways in which we can look through a list of values
        stored in an array and find a particular piece of data).
      </li>
      <li>
        While computers today ARE much faster than before (When searching
        through huge lists, small differences in efficiency add up).
      </li>
      <li>
        Efficiency is based on two values (Worst case scenario, Average number
        of items)
      </li>
      <li>Known as Big 0 notation.</li>
      <li>The linear search can work on both sorted and unsorted lists.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>18.What is Recursion?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How can we use functions which call each other to break down problems?
      </li>
      <li>
        In Introductions that occur within a function(One of the instructions
        will be a call to that same function)
      </li>
      <li>
        Recursion is so useful because it breaks large problems into much
        simpler pieces to compute.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>19. What is Pseudocode?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most programmers spend the majority of their job thinking about code
        rather than writing it.
      </li>
      <li>Programmers use Pseudocode to plan out their code.</li>
      <li>
        Pseudocode can be compared to an outline for a paper. Explain the main
        topics of the essay and plan out the major talking points. Don’t worry
        about the nitty gritty details (Word Choice, Grammar Conventions, Proper
        Formatting).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Review</strong></li>
      <li>
        Flowchart Method (Good for thinking through the flow of a function).
      </li>
      <li>
        Write-Up Method (Good for getting the general idea of a program down).
      </li>
      <li>
        Functionality Planning Method (Good for listing out the functions of a
        certain program).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>20.Choosing the right Language.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Now that you have a basic understanding of computer science, what kind
        of language should you delve into?
      </li>
      <li>
        Higher-Level Languages (More abstract from machine code, Easier to
        learn).
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower-Level Languages (Closer to machine code, Harder to learn, often
        provides more functionality).
      </li>
      <li>
        The world of computer science is vast and contains many fields, so
        trying to cover everything in one language would be impossible (Led to
        the creation of thousands of different programming languages.
      </li>
      <li>HTML and CSS (Used for web development).</li>
      <li>
        HTML (A markup language used for writing the content of a website).
      </li>
      <li>CSS (Used to design the style of a website).</li>
      <li>Many times also used in WEB Development.</li>
      <li>
        General Purpose Languages (offer a wide variety of uses and
        applications, very good basic languages).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>21.Applications of Programming.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Research a language we ‘ve talked about that interests you (Official
        Websites, Wikipedia Page).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don’t know what you want to make (Use websites that have provided
        prompts to kick-start your code-writing.
      </li>
      <li>The world of code has now been opened up to you.</li>
    </ul>
