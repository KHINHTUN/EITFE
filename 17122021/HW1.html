      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Editing <strong> HTML </strong>and<strong> CSS </strong> code can be
        done with nothing but a simple text editor.However,if you’d <br />like
        to take your programming skills <i>(and output)</i> to the next
        level,it’s worth looking into an integrated development environment or
        <strong> IDE </strong>.<br />
        A bare-bones<strong> IDE </strong>will allow you to code,edit, test, and
        debug. However, an advanced<strong> IDE </strong>, like the ones<br />
        listed here, will offer many features that will enhance your programming
        experiences like automation, visualization, and customization.
      </p>
      <h3>We should use the IDE</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
        <li>Sublime Text3</li>
        <li>NetBeans</li>
        <li>PyCharm</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>1.Visual Studio Code</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
        <dd>+ High speed</dd>
        <dd>+ Beginner friendly</dd>
        <dd>+ Well documented</dd>
        <dd>+ Interoperability</dd>
        <dd>+ Independency</dd>
        <dd>- Security</dd>
        <dd>- Controllable</dd>
        <dd>- Compatibility</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>2.IntelliJ IDEA</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
        <dd>
          + Inbuilt support for a web server which makes Java web application
          faster.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + Auto code completion. By just typing a few words, it will complete
          the whole code block like try catch.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + Lots of plugins like<strong> Sonar Lint </strong>. Using those you
          can analyse your code while writing it.
        </dd>
        <dd>+ Provides a decompiled code of libraries which can help a lot.</dd>
        <dd>- It is a very heavy tool and consumes a lot of memory.</dd>
        <dd>
          - If you are a new java developer, then you shouldn't use it heavily
          as it will affect your learning ability.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>3.Sublime Text</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
        <dd>
          + The biggest advantage over many other editors is the ability to open
          large files. Some editors just can't open a<strong> CSV </strong>with
          millions of lines but<br /><strong> Sublime Text </strong> does it
          like a champ.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + Multiple selections let you change or create many instances of the
          same variable or value with ease.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + The<i> Goto Anything </i> simplifies navigation and lets you
          control, open, or move within files without ever having to take your
          hands off the keyboard.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + Likewise, the command palette allows you to access any of the
          application's functionality right from the keyboard.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + It is highly customizable with a rich ecosystem of third party
          plugins and the ability to create your own.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          - In a world of free and open text editors,<strong>
            Sublime Text </strong
          >does ask for donations. You can use the product freely with only a
          very infrequent popup <br />
          asking for donations. You can use it however long you like without
          paying, but it is well worth it to donate to.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          - People not used to the functionality may need a bit of time to get
          up to speed using the documentation.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          - An integrated terminal would be nice, but that is just a quibble.
          It's hard to find many cons with<strong> Sublime Text </strong>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>4.NetBeans</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
        <dd>
          + Formatting and defining rules for each language is a very useful
          feature in this<strong> IDE </strong>.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          + The code can be deployed very easy from<strong> Netbeans </strong>
          itself.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          - It should provide more themes and background colors for the code
        </dd>
        window. Some dark themes are good but they slow down the system.<br />
        <dd>
          - There have been a few bugs in the latest version of<strong>
            NetBeans </strong
          >. <br />
          <strong> NetBean's </strong>developer should resolve those bugs.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>5.PyCharm</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pros&Cons</dt>
        <dd>+ Data science scripting.</dd>
        <dd>+ Frontend development based on Python.</dd>
        <dd>
          - Community edition is, while quite usable, far behind the paid
          alternative. At least a basic database support would be nice.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h1>Top 10 In-Demand Programming Languages in 2021</h1>
      <h2>Top Programming Languages 2021</h2>
      <p>
        Today we are using technology and it is having an effect.Most people are
        now effectively using computer-understood languages and programming
        languages.<br />
        People control computers and write programs and create software. There
        are two programming languages: advanced programming languages <br />
        and low-level programming languages. Advanced programming language is
        easy to understand and can write words and source code symbols,<br />
        for example<strong> -( Java, C ++, PHP) </strong>Advanced programming
        language is understood as a business model that can run as fast as the
        program provides the cost of the vehicle.<br />
        Of the many programming languages so far,which one is the best in<strong>
          2021 </strong
        >and how will it be used in the future ? Therefore,programmers are
        needed in the future.

      <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Developers use suitable programming languages for their own
        particular<br />
        project purpose or syntax they want to use to generate instructions.<br />
        Here are different sorts of programming languages they use-
      </p>
      <li>
        <a
          target="_blank"

        /></a>
      </li>
      <hr />
      <h2>Low-level Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Using these kinds of languages offers abstraction from the hardware and
        are depicted in the binary<br />
        form that is either<i> 0 or 1 </i>referred to as machine
        instruction.<strong> Low-level </strong>languages also have two
        types<strong
          ><br />
          Machine-level languages.<br />
          Assembly Level Languages.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>High-level Languages</h2>
      <p>
        It permits developers to code programs that are not related to the type
        of<br />
        computer. These are close to human languages and understandable
        easily,<br />
        it’s just that it needs attention for the problem<strong> LogiC </strong
        >. It has advantages<br />
        like Easy to maintain and learn Portability with the
        machine-independency.

        We can see in the<strong> US </strong> , mobile manufacturers and
